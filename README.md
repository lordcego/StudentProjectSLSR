This Project is not being used for earning any money, it was made to learn abot the GPIL algorithm and the Expectation Maximization all credit goes to: Ryan Turner, Carl Edward Rasmussen and Marc Deisenroth.

# Description
This project implements the GPIL algorithm from RyanTurner in order to find a predictive distribution of the latent states, and optimizes the hidden parameters bei implementing a forward-Backward algrothm inside of the escope of a  Expectation Maximization schema.
